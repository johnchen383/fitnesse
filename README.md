# Fitnesse

Repository with working version of FitNesse wiki and automated testing tool.

Could not get working on my Windows machine most probably due to the space in classpaths. Though, working on Linux VM provided for SE206.

To run FitNesse on port 8888, run the following command.

`java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8888`
